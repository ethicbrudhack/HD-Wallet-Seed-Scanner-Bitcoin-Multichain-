# HD-Wallet-Seed-Scanner-Bitcoin-Multichain-
This Python script generates random BIP-39 mnemonic seed phrases, derives their HD wallet addresses for multiple blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.), and checks whether any of those addresses appear in a local SQLite address database.  It is built purely for research and educational purposes.
